Project Title: Rental Houses 

 Problem Statement
Lack of a comprehensive platform for easy apartment searching and booking:
Finding apartments for rent is often time-consuming, and renters face multiple challenges when trying to gather information. Current platforms often lack integrated services such as detailed house descriptions, images, availability calendars, and streamlined booking and payment processes. According to a recent survey, 70% of renters report frustration with having to contact property owners manually to confirm availability or inquire about payments, leading to inefficiency and potential missed opportunities. This highlights the need for a more seamless, user-friendly system that enables renters to search, view, and book apartments effortlessly in one place.
B. Project Description:

The Property Rental Management System is designed to streamline property management tasks for landlords, property managers, and tenants. It offers features like property listing management, tenant application processing, lease tracking, online rent payments, and maintenance request handling. The system aims to simplify communication between all parties, improve tenant satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, it includes financial reporting, vacancy tracking, and automated notifications to ensure timely lease renewals and payments, ultimately providing a seamless rental experience.


Objectives
